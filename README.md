#### General List
A short review of the papers/projects/repos that can be helpful in creative ML

## Intro:
For the final projects, I am aiming for two main categories: </br>
   1. Camera Pose Estimation from a Single RGB Image  </br>
   2. Human Pose Estimation from a Single RGB Image  </br>


In each category, I introduce multiple cases that can be used as a part of the proposed framework. </br>

The rest of this post will include: </br>
   1. [Camera Pose Estimation](/README.md#Camera-Pose-Estimation)  </br>
   2. [Question Samples](/README.md#question-samples)  </br>
